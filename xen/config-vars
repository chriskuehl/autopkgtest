adt_testbed_ram		256 [Mby]
	Physical RAM allocated for each testbed instance while
	creating and running.

adt_freeze_ram		32 [Mby]
	Physical RAM size for frozen image; we reduce the testbed
	to this before freezing it and grow it again when we resume
	it.

adt_filesys_size	1G
	Size of base filesystem image.  Should be big enough to
	contain all of the software under test and all of its working
	space, as no running testbed can ever use more than this
	(despite copy-on-write).

adt_filesys_snapsize	500M
	Space to allocate for copy-on-write snapshot data.  This is
	the maximum amount of data that a running testbed can use.
	This value should be less than the adt_filesys_size.

adt_filesys_cowchunk	8 [Mby]
	Copy-on-write chunk size.

adt_nominum		adt
	Namespace prefix for Xen domains, LVM volumes, devmapper
	devices, entries in /dev, files in /var, and so on.  You may
	run several instances of the adt virtualisation system with
	different nominums and they won't interact.

adt_lvm_vg		the system's LVM volume group if there is only one
	LVM volume group to create base filesystem image in.

adt_kernel		the booted kernel file /boot/xen*`uname -r`
	Kernel to boot in the testbed image

adt_ramdisk		<kernel>.initrd.img
	Initial ramdisk to provide to the testbid image.
	"none" means do not provide an initial ramdisk.
