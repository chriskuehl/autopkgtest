.SH DESCRIPTION
.B adt\-virt\-null
provides a dummy autopkgtest virtualisation server which does not
actually offer any kind of separation between host and testbed.

Normally
.B adt-virt-null
will be invoked by
.BR adt-run .

There is of course no locking; nothing prevents multiple simultaneous
programs from invoking
.B adt-virt-null
so as to reuse the same system as a testbed.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BR \-d " | " \-\-debug
Enables debugging output.  Probably not hugely interesting.

.SH INPUT, OUTPUT AND EXIT STATUS
The behaviour of
.B adt-virt-null
is as described by the AutomatedTesting virtualisation regime
specification.
