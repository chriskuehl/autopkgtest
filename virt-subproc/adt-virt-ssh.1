.SH NAME
adt\-virt\-ssh \- autopkgtest virtualisation server using SSH

.SH SYNOPSYS
.B adt\-virt\-ssh
.RI [ options ]
.I [\fI-- setup script options\fR ...]


.SH DESCRIPTION
.B adt-virt-ssh
provides an autopkgtest virtualisation server using SSH.

Normally
.B adt-virt-ssh
will be invoked by
.BR adt-run .

.B adt-virt-ssh

can use an already existing ssh target, or call a setup script to create/set up
a test bed and the ssh server.

.B WARNING!
adt-virt-ssh will modify the target system by installing packages and running
arbitrary test code, so
.B you are responsible for resetting the testbed youself
especially without a setup script. So use this with care.

.SH REQUIREMENTS
.B adt-virt-ssh
doesn't assume anything regarding the target host other than that the given ssh
connection (and networking) stay available all the time. You can provide
credententials on the command line for already working SSH hosts or use a
setup script to prepare the host for the connection (see
.B SETUP SCRIPT
below for more information), for example to create a
forwarding rule to access an adb host over ssh or fire-up a cloud instance.

.SH OPTIONS

.TP
.BR -h | --help
Show the help message and exit

.TP
.BR -d | --debug
Enable debugging output

.TP
.BI  -H  " hostname" " | --hostname=" hostname
Connects and logs into the specified hostname or IP address

.TP
.BI  -l " user" " | --login=" user
Specifies the user to log in as on the remote machine.

.TP
.BI  -i " identity" " | --identity=" identity
Selects a file from which the identity (private key) for public key
authentication is read. Should usually be
.BR ~/.ssh/id_rsa ,
but you might consider using a different key for tests.

.TP
.BI  -P " password" " | --password=" password
Specifies the sudo password on the remote host.

It can be the password in clear text or a file containing the password. This
password will be used to setup $SUDO_ASKPASS in the case sudo requires a
password. The runner will check if the user has sudo access with and without a
password. If the check fails, the capability "root-on-testbed" will not be
available. If sudo works, then tests that run as user will have
$SUDO_ASKPASS in their environment so that they can run
.B sudo -A
if needed.

.TP
.BI  -p " port" " | --port=" port
ssh port to use to connect to the host

.TP
.BI  -o " options" " | --options=" options
Passed verbatim to ssh; see man ssh_config

.TP
.BI  -s " setup_script" " | --setup-script=" setup_script
Setup script to prepare testbed and ssh connection (See
.B SETUP SCRIPT
below for more information). File names
will be searched in both the current directory and in
.B /usr/share/autopkgtest/ssh-setup/
so you do not need to give the full path for setup scripts shipped with
autopkgtest.

.TP
.BI -- " [setup script arguments] "
All the remaining arguments following \fB--\fR will be passed verbatim to the setup
script to configure the host.


.SH CONFIGURATION FILES
If you use lots of options or hosts, you can put parts of, or the whole
command line into a text file, with one line per option. E. g. you can create a
file
.I testhost.cfg
with contents like

.RS
.EX
-Htest.example.com
-ltestuser
-Ps3kr1t
.EE
.RE

and then run

.RS
.EX
adt-run [...] --- adt-virt-ssh @testhost.cfg
.EE
.RE

The contents of the configuration file will be expanded in-place as if you
would have given its contents on the command line. Please ensure that you
.B don't place spaces
between short options and their values, they would become a part of the
argument value.

.SH INPUT, OUTPUT AND EXIT STATUS
The behaviour of
.B adt-virt-ssh
is as described by the AutomatedTesting virtualisation regime
specification.

.SH NOTES

\fBadt-run\fR does not run \fBapt-get update\fR at the start of a package
build, which can cause a build failure if you are using a development
series template. You will need to run \fBapt-get update\fR in the template
yourself (e. g. using \fB\-\-setup\-commands\fR).

.SH SETUP SCRIPT

.B adt-virt-ssh
accepts a setup script in argument to prepare the testbed and the ssh
connection. A setup script is an executable that gets called with a command as
first argument, and additional options for that command.

.SS command: open
When called with "open", the script has to create a testbed (if necessary),
configure ssh, copy ssh key into it, configure sudo, etc.

It then returns the following information on standard output with the form
\fBkey=value\fR, one line per pair. These mostly mirror the command line
options when not using a script.

Required fields:

.IP * 4
login: User name

.IP * 4
hostname: hostname or IP address

.PP
Optional fields:

.IP * 4
identity: Path to the private key

.IP * 4
password: sudo password for the user name to acquire root privileges. If not
given, and passwordless sudo does not work, the testbed will not have root
privileges.

.IP * 4
port: SSH port on hostname, if different than 22

.IP * 4
capabilities: extra testbed capabilities such as "isolation-machine" or
"revert", see README.virtualisation-server.rst

.IP * 4
options: passed verbatim to ssh, see man ssh_config

.IP * 4
extraopts: passed verbatim to other commands; this allows extra state (such as
temporary directory names, VM identifiers, etc.) to be passed to cleanup

.SS command: cleanup
Called when closing the testbed; should revert/remove things installed in
open as much as possible if the testbed is not ephemeral. This gets called with
all the options that open got called with, plus
.BR extraopts .

.SS command: revert
If there is a way to reset the testbed to its pristine state (such as using VM
snapshots or rebuilding ephemeral testbeds), the script should put "revert"
(and if appropriate, "revert-full-system") into the capabilities and implement
this command. This can optionally output some or all of the ssh config keys
from open() to update the configuration, in case the hostname/IP changes.

.SS command: reboot
If the testbed can be rebooted with keeping state, the script should put
"reboot" into the capabilities and implement this command. If calling "reboot"
through ssh works, this can just exit with code 10.

.SS Included scripts

.RE
autopkgtest provides setup scripts for common types of testbeds in
.BR /usr/share/autopkgtest/ssh-setup/ .
Please see the comments in these scripts for how to use them. Also, please
consider using
.B /usr/share/autopkgtest/ssh-setup/SKELETON
as a basis for writing your own.

.SH EXAMPLES

Run the tests of the libpng source package on an existing "mytesthost":

.RS
.EX
adt-run libpng --- ssh -H mytesthost -l joe -P /tmp/joe_password
.EE
.RE

Run the tests of a click package on an Ubuntu phone with an ssh connection over
ADB, using the setup script, with specifying an option to the setup script to
pick a particular serial ID:

.RS
.EX
adt-run ./ubuntu-calculator-app ./com.ubuntu.calculator_1.3.283_all.click \\
  --- ssh -s /usr/share/autopkgtest/ssh-setup/adb -- -s 0123456789abcdef
