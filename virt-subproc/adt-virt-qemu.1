.SH NAME
adt\-virt\-qemu \- autopkgtest virtualisation server using QEMU

.SH SYNOPSYS
.B adt\-virt\-qemu
.RI [ options ]
.I image \fR[\fIro-image\fR ...]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B adt-virt-qemu
provides an autopkgtest virtualisation server using QEMU.

Normally
.B adt-virt-qemu
will be invoked by
.BR adt-run .

You always need to specify at least one QEMU VM image. If your VM needs
more disks, you can specify arbitrarily many additional images which will
be added in order.

.B adt-virt-qemu
does
.B not modify
the given images, but will instead create a temporary overlay for the
primary image, and add all other images as read-only.

.SH REQUIREMENTS
.B adt-virt-qemu
assumes that you have already prepared a suitable Debian based QEMU image.
autopkgtest provides \fBadt-buildvm-ubuntu-cloud\fR(1) to build a VM based
on the Ubuntu cloud images, but you can use any VM which satisfies one of:

.IP * 4
They open a root shell on ttyS1, or

.IP * 4
They have a serial console on ttyS0 where you can log in (getty or similar)
with specified user and password. This will then be used to start a root
shell on ttyS1, to reduce this to the first case and to not assume that
ttyS0 stays operational throughout the whole test.

.SH OPTIONS

.TP
.BI -u " user" " | --user=" user

User name for running tests that don't require root privileges.

If the VM is not already prepared to start a root shell on ttyS1 this will be
also used for logging in on ttyS0. If this is not root, it must be able to run
sudo without a password to become root for that purpose.

.TP
.BI -p " password" " | --password=" password
Password for above user for logging into the VM on ttyS0. This is necessary
if the VM is not already prepared to start a root shell on ttyS1.

.TP
.BI -q " command" " | --qemu-command=" command
QEMU command to run. This defaults to the
.B qemu-system-*
that matches your system architecture.

.TP
.BI -o " dir" " | --overlay-dir=" dir
Directory where the temporary image overlay for the primary image is
created. By default this will happen in a work directory in
.I /tmp
(or \fI$TMPDIR\fR), but you can use this to e. g. ensure that the overlay
is placed on a tmpfs if your
.I /tmp
directory is not on tmpfs. This will greatly increase the speed.

.TP
.BI "--ram-size=" MiB
VM RAM size in MiB. Default is 1024, i. e. 1 GiB.

.TP
.BR \-d " | " \-\-debug
Enable debugging output.

.SH CONFIGURATION FILES
If you use lots of options or images, you can put parts of, or the whole
command line into a text file, with one line per option. E. g. you can create a
file
.I sid-desktop.cfg
with contents like

.RS
.EX
-utestuser
-ps3kr1t
--ram-size=4096
/home/bob/autopkgtest/sid-desktop.img
.EE
.RE

and then run

.RS
.EX
adt-run [...] --- adt-virt-qemu @sid-desktop.cfg
.EE
.RE

The contents of the configuration file will be expanded in-place as if you
would have given its contents on the command line. Please ensure that you
.B don't place spaces
between short options and their values, they would become a part of the
argument value.

.SH INPUT, OUTPUT AND EXIT STATUS
The behaviour of
.B adt-virt-qemu
is as described by the AutomatedTesting virtualisation regime
specification.

.SH NOTES

\fBadt-run\fR does not run \fBapt-get update\fR at the start of a package
build, which can cause a build failure if you are using a development
series template. You will need to run \fBapt-get update\fR in the template
yourself (e. g. using \fB\-\-setup\-commands\fR).

.SH EXAMPLE

Create an Ubuntu cloud image for the current development series and the i386
architecture:

.RS
.EX
adt-buildvm-ubuntu-cloud -v -a i386
.EE
.RE

This will produce e. g.
.B adt-trusty-i386-cloud.img\fR.
Now run the tests of the libpng source package of that release, using that
image:

.RS
.EX
adt-run libpng --- adt-virt-qemu adt-trusty-i386-cloud.img
.EE
.RE
