autopkgtest (2.3.4) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * Add tests/testpkg/: Simple source package for testing autopkgtest.
  * Add tests/adt-run: Automatic regression tests for adt-run, covering/using
    the null runner.
  * Add debian/tests: autopkgtest for autopkgtest, using tests/adt-run.
  * Make topmost temporary directory group/world-readable and make $ADTTMP
    have appropriate 1777 permissions so that users other than root can
    actually use it. (Closes: #722458)
  * Don't clip first stderr line to 35 characters in summary. (Side issue in
    #722457)
  * Don't show shell tracing of script that creates the temporary directories.
  * Move unimportant messages to debug level 1, to not clutter up default
    output so much.
  * Drop unnecessary "trace: " from adt-run debug/progress lines.
  * Show stdout/err of the running tests in realtime, which is much nicer for
    watching. Don't split that realtime output, so that stderr messages appear
    in the right context. Show separate stderr if and only if the allow-stderr
    restriction is not set and there is stderr output. (Closes: #722457)
  * For tests with "build-needed", actually run the tests in the built
    directory, not in the original unbuilt tree. (Closes: #711209)
  * Fix various unknown and unused symbols throughout the source, spotted by
    pyflakes.
  * Add tests/pyflakes: Run pyflakes over source and test code.
  * Add tests/pep8: Run pep8 over source and test code.
  * Support empty "Depends:" test control field, installing no dependencies in
    that case.
  * README.package-tests: Point out that you can use upper-case test names as
    well. Update test_tree_tmp_dir() test to use these, to ensure it stays
    working. (Closes: #711844)
  * Some code cleanups:
    - Don't rename modules on import.
    - Format to be PEP-8 compliant.
  * Run tests/pep8 and tests/pyflakes during package build.

autopkgtest (2.3.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * runner/adt-run: Drop "errors" keyword from decode() call to fix
    compatibility with earlier Python versions. Thanks Christoph Berg.
  * adt-run: Fail tests if they exit with nonzero if "allow-stderr"
    restriction is set. Thanks Robie Basak! (LP: #1210503)

autopkgtest (2.3.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * runner/adt-run: Fix "allow-stderr" restrictions to still report success,
    so that this gets into the summary.log.

 -- Martin Pitt <mpitt@debian.org>  Fri, 26 Jul 2013 12:41:07 +0200

autopkgtest (2.3.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * adt-run: Support older python-debian versions whose module was still
    called "debian_bundle". (Closes: #717191)
  * runner/adt-run: Correctly re-raise exception on some register failure
    errors. Thanks Robie Basak!
  * runner/adt-run: Short-circuit publishing if there are no registered built
    binaries. This is the step that takes by far the longest time for short
    tests, and thus speeds up test running significantly.
  * runner/adt-run: Set DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive for installing build or
    test dependencies, too. Thanks Robie Basak! (LP: #1204989)

autopkgtest (2.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * runner/adt-run.1: Fix bad "affect modify" wording. (LP: #1199500)
  * Drop hosts/chinstrap. We haven't actually used this in many years, it has
    been replaced with https://launchpad.net/auto-package-testing, Jenkins,
    and blocking migration to release until tests pass. (LP: #381210)
  * Promote apt-utils from Recommends to Depends:, to avoid test failures due
    to not finding apt-ftparchive. (LP: #1065874)
  * Promote pbuilder from Recommends: to Depends:, as we always call
    pbuilder-satisfydepends-classic. (LP: #1065874)
  * runner/adt-run: Stop explicitly checking for $HOME (with broken error
    message) when giving --gnupg-home, use os.path.expanduser() instead.
    (LP: #1065873)
  * runner/adt-run: Fix timeout --help output.
  * runner/adt-run: Fix bomb() to clean up the testbed before removing it.
    Afterwards (in cleanup()) we don't have a testbed object any more to run
    commands in. (LP: #1157292)
  * runner/adt-run: Fix UnicodeDecodeError crash if stderr contains non-ASCII
    characters. (LP: #1100283)
  * Add "allow-stderr" restriction for tests where re-routing or disabling
    stderr is impractical. (LP: #1197005)
  * runner-adt-run: Support architecture specifiers in Depends: field.
    (LP: #1165128)
  * runner/adt-run: Remove/fix some unused variables, spotted by pyflakes.

  * Fix failure with "permission denied" with option --user. Closes: #686292,
    LP: #1084116

    Closes: #693540, LP: #1164362

  [ Martin Pitt ]

autopkgtest (2.2.2) unstable; urgency=low

autopkgtest (2.2.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Provide tests with ADTTMP rather than TMPDIR.

    Well, actually, that's just according to the spec.  In reality, for
    backward compatibity, we provide each test script with both (pointing
    to different directories so that tests don't need to worry about
    possible filename clashes between ADTTMP and TMPDIR).

  Documentation fixes:
  * Clarify the spec to say that copyup/down takes encoded filenames.
  * Fix the spec to refer to `breaks-testbed' rather than `breaks-computer'.
    Report from Jakub Wilk.  Closes: #669721.
  * Manpage should refer to `*' in tests file's Depends field, not `@'.
    Report from Jakub Wilk.  Closes: #670648.

  Packaging fixes:
  * Add Recommends against pbuilder, whose dependency resolver adt-run
    uses.
  * Remove runner/tmp on debian/rules clean, and add it to .gitignore,
    for convenience.

  * adt-testreport-onepackage etc.: new blacklist feature, and initially
    blacklist ltsp-client{,-core}.
  * adt-testreport-onepackage: limit log to 64K (32K head, 32K tail)
    to avoid humungous bug reports which LP silently discards.
  * hosts/cadmium/lalonde-nightly: check for testbed sentinel file

    this improves dependency problem reporting.  (LP: #135581.)
  * adt-testreport-onepackage: seddery the log to remove ctrl chars.
    In particular, this gets rid of ^M's from apt which get corrupted
    by email transport and thus break the email signatures.
  * hosts/chinstrap/update-suppressions: pass -S to curl.

    - Capability to suppress emails similar to ones already sent.
    - Launchpad bug filing including PGP-signing, `affects' line, etc.
    - Capability to suppress email for packages listed in a
      suppression file.
    - Better formatting and explanations in some emails.

    - Options for setting timeouts.
    - Increase default timeouts 100s, 3ks, 10ks, 100ks.
  
  * hosts/chinstrap/*:
     Screen-scrape Launchpad to get existing bugs and generate a suitable
     suppression file so we file a bug iff there isn't one already. 
  
  * hosts/cadmium/*:
     New directory for convenience scripts etc on Canonical buildd.

  * Set LANG to C by default for commands (eg builds and tests) run on
    testbed, and make this configurable.
  * Make builds work again: Fix `cd *' in work.write (broken by
    inclusion of `tmpdir' in that directory).
  * adt-testreport-onepackage has better reporting for DC-running.
  * Fix handling of non-.deb-producing source packages (eg, ones
    which produce only .udebs).

  * xenlvm command-line settings properly override config file
    settings everywhere.
  * Default value for adt_distro computed in time to be used for
    default value for adt_play.
  * Close fd 4 for lvm tools too (suppresses daft `File descriptor
    left open' message).
  * Change default lvm lv sizes and make documentation correspond
    to reality.

 -- Ian Jackson <ian@davenant.greenend.org.uk>  Fri, 13 Jul 2007 15:31:58 +0100

autopkgtest (1.0.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * adt_debootstrap_opts mentioned in README and passable on

  * Dependency on pbuilder fixed; we use debootstrap, not pbuilder.

autopkgtest (1.0.0) gutsy; urgency=low

  * Locking: <play>.lock (unlinkable fcntl style) plus <play>/good
    sentinel file.  This will avoid conflicts between simultaneous calls
    to with-testbed and setup (and others).  The `with' mode of the userv
    target is enhanced so that the caller can take out the lock and hold
    it will starting and discarding the testbed more than once.

autopkgtest (0.9.1) gutsy; urgency=low

  * autopkgtest-xenlvm declares that it Depends on dmsetup.
  * Discard stderr from our ought-to-be-unnecessary modprobe dm-snapshot.
  * New `console' mode for userv service.
  * Move README.userv to autopkgtest-xenlvm package (and hence to
    /usr/share/doc/autopkgtest-xenlvm).
  * Do not mind if directory named by adt_modules doesn't exist - in
    that case just don't copy any modules.
  * Attempt to install libc6-xen in fixups-inside, rather than instructing
    debootstrap to install it.  This makes us not mind if it's missing.

 -- Ian Jackson <iwj@ubuntu.com>  Thu, 12 Jul 2007 09:50:13 +0100

autopkgtest (0.9.0) gutsy; urgency=low

  New features:
  * userv service for testbed invocation now provided and
    at least somewhat tested, and useable by adt-virt-xenlvm.
  * New print-execute-command command for virtualisation servers.
  * New adt_sshauthkeys_hook config variable.
  * pass count= to dd for erasure when lvm_erasebase=true.

  Bugfixes:
  * Fix filename pattern bug which can prevent automatic keypair
    generation (false claim that privkey and pubkey do not match).
  * Do not demand vg or distro information for initscript to work.
  * export adt_* variable settings resulting from command-line
    arguments so that subprocesses get them properly, and arrange
    for the `defaults for simple settings' not to override environment
    variables.
  * suppress various variable settings' default computations (and
    consequent failure if the default can't be established) when
    processing config for the initscript.  The initscript does not
    need per-testbed configuration options.
  * close fd 8 when running vgdisplay (which avoids an annoying and
    spurious warning from the lvm tools).

  Packaging:
  * autopkgtest-xenlvm now Recommends: lvm2 and debootstrap.
  * autopkgtest Suggests curl (adt-testreport-onepackage needs it).

  Portability:
  * Check for udev persistent-net-generator and if enabled we
    write a rune for eth0 for guest_macaddr into the RULES_FILE
    specified in /lib/udev/write_net_rules.  (Needed for gutsy.)
  * Remove iwj-specific stuff from adt-testreport-onepackage and put
    it into onepackage-config with scary warnings to tell people to
    edit the file.

  Documentation:
  * ip forwarding warning clarified.
  * README documentation of default value for erasebase corrected.

  * Fix readconfig.in to set adt_$var rather than just $var.
  * Use fd 8 for readconfig stdout parking rather than fd 10, to avoid
    Debian #423400 (bash bug).
  * Truncate files when writing them (copyup, copydown, etc) (!)
  * Remove spurious \ from `do not know how to handle filename' message.

autopkgtest (0.8.2) gutsy unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix fd handling to work around Python's habit of closing files
    you specify in subprocess.Popen.
  * Error handling bugfixes: say except (IOError,OSError) everywhere
    rather than just one of those two; correct harmless bug in gpg key
    generation error handling.
  * Make adt-virt-null work properly (VirtSubProc runs `down' with
    a single argument, so down must be sh -c and not []).
  * In VirtSubProc close spurious copy of plumbing pipe, which prevents
    certain hangs during error situations.
  * Xen cleanup script runs dmsetup info / dmsetup remove several times
    with some sleeps because xm destroy is not properly instantaneous.
  * Fix handling of pre-built source trees.
  * Fix cleanup handling not to delete tmpdir before resetting testbed's
    apt.

autopkgtest (0.8.0) feisty; urgency=low

  * adt-run: new --instantiate option to allow package installation to be
    forced for testing.  (This is not an ideal approach - it's not very
    flexible - but works well enough for the current requirements.)
  * adt-testreport-onepackage: new ability to test binary as well as
    source packages, using new --instantiate option.
  * new `timeout=' option on `execute' virt server command.
  * set some default timeouts (these should be settable with options,
    really).
  * Default kernel image guesser is more sophisticated - now we look
    for something that looks like a Xen kernel rather than guessing
    from the filename since the filenames seem unstable.
  * Default setting for adt_fw_allowglobalports is none.
  * Set DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive.
  * Run udevsettle after xm destroy but before dmsetup remove.
  * Run sendmail -odi not -odq in adt-testreport-onepackage.
  * Longer timeouts by default.
  * Print `adt-run: trace' for trace output.
  * Show all apt stdout (including dpkg stdout) in contemporaneous trace.
