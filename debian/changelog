  [ Martin Pitt ]
  * doc/README.package-tests: Clarify syntax of test Depends:, and point to
    the relevant Debian Policy specification.
  * adt-build-lxc: Fall back to assuming /var/lib/lxc/ as container directory
    if lxc-config does not exist. It was introduced in 1.0, but Debian
    unstable still has 0.9. (Closes: #740437)
  * tests: Extend test_artifacts() to multiple tests writing artifacts, also
    with overwriting existing files and writing into subdirs.
  * VirtSubproc: Fix copyup_shareddir() to get along with existing
    directories. (LP: #1288668)

autopkgtest (2.9) unstable; urgency=low

  New features:
  * Add "downtmp-host=<path>" testbed capability, for runners which can set up
    a shared directory between host and testbed. This is used by copyupdown to
    more efficiently copy files back and forth, and in many/most cases, don't
    explicitly copy anything at all.
  * Introduce a new testbed capability "downtmp-shared-fifo" that declares
    that testbed and the host can use a FIFO in the shared downtmp for
    communication. Use this to generalize live test output to all runners
    which declare that, not just -null.
  * Convert null, chroot, schroot, lxc, and qemu runners to use a shared
    downtmp dir. Note that qemu does not support FIFO (through the 9p file
    system), so that one does not get live test output.
  * Don't define $TMPDIR for tests any more. Having $TMPDIR in the shared dir
    isn't efficient and even breaks some tests (as they might not be able to
    put sockets etc. into it), and it's an artificial difference to the
    default system behaviour of just using /tmp. The documentation already was
    changed a long time ago to only document $ADTTMP as a scratch directory
    for tests.
  * Add test restrictions "isolation-container" and "isolation-machine", and
    corresponding testbed capabilities. Tests can use that to declare that
    they want to start services or open ports (i. e. a simple chroot/schroot
    is insufficient) or access hardware, reboot,  and interact the kernel
    (where even a container is insufficient), and will be skipped instead of
    failing when they run in a virtualization server which does not provide
    enough isolation.
  * Add manpage for adt-build-lxc script.
  * Ship adt-build-lxc script and its manpage in the package.

  Documentation updates:
  * doc/README.package-tests: Some stylistic updates, and add section headers.
  * adt-virt-lxc.1: Point to, and show how to use adt-build-lxc.
  * Add doc/README.running-tests: Overview of how to run adt-run, most common
    scenarios, and available virtualization servers with their pros/cons.

  Bug fixes:
  * tests: Copy tests/home/ into a temporary dir and set $HOME to that, to
    avoid cluttering the source dir.
  * Don't produce empty stderr/stdout files with --output-dir. (LP: #1282866)
  * adt-buildvm-ubuntu-cloud: Install linux-generic, to get the full kernel
    (needed for e. g. udisks2 to get scsi_debug).
  * tests: Add a broken symlink to testpkg, to ensure that copying trees
    around gets along with those.
  * adt-run: Always use fakeroot with adt-virt-qemu, to work around chown
    failing on 9p.
  * xen/initscript: Always source /lib/lsb/init-functions. (Thanks lintian)
  * tests/adt-run: Increase timeout in NullRunner.test_timeout_long_build to
    avoid failure on slow architectures.
  * adt-build-lxc: Properly wait for finished container boot instead of a
    static 10 second sleep.
  * adt-build-lxc: Only flush the cache when updating an existing container.

  * Use the install timeout instead of the short one for
    --setup-commands/--apt-upgrade.
  * Fix --apt-upgrade to not hang on dpkg conffile prompts.
  * Use ./tests/home/ as $HOME during tests, and add a gpg key to it so that
    we don't have to generate one (which often hangs due to lack of entropy).
  * Make the test suite run as user, skip tests which require root (all
    ChrootRunner and most NullRunner tests).

autopkgtest (2.8) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Add adt-virt-qemu: Virtualization server using QEMU. This provides even
    more isolation than containers and thus is able to run tests which
    interact with the kernel. See the manpage for the requirements that VMs
    need to satisfy, and how to use it. (Closes: #719215)
  * Add adt-buildvm-ubuntu-cloud: This tool downloads an Ubuntu cloud image
    and configures it for autopkgtest. See its manpage for how to use it.
  * adt-run: Stop using a $TMPDIR for package builds. It's unnecessary
    overhead, and causes problems with dpkg-deb if it is on e. g. a 9p file
    system.
  * Allow the virt-server argument to be given without the common "adt-virt-"
    prefix, for brevity. Update the manpage accordingly, and also move
    virt-server into its own heading instead of burying it in the middle of
    "other options".
  * tests: Show stderr output if adt-run unexpectedly fails.
  * Fix endless recursion when an error happens during resetting apt.
  * tests: Fix skip message if no container is given; it does not need to be
    an Ubuntu cloud container any more.
  * Add tools/adt-build-lxc: Script to create or upgrade a Debian/Ubuntu
    container, suitable as a daily cron (or Jenkins) job. Not shipped in
    package for now.
  * Allow --setup-commands to be given multiple times.
  * Add -U/--apt-upgrade option to run apt-get update/dist-upgrade before
    running the test.
  * Add --apt-pocket <pocket> option to create an additional apt source for
    release-pocket.

autopkgtest (2.7.2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * debian/copyright, CREDITS: Bump copyright year.
  * Eliminate lib/Autopkgtest.py, use pipes.quote() instead of shellquote_*().
  * Drop doc/README.schroot-setup. Using LVM for schroot overlays is not
    recommended as it is too slow and also too hard to set up. You should
    rather use overlays or unpacked tarballs on tmpfs. Adjust
    adt-virt-schroot.1 to point to mk-sbuild(1) instead.
  * CREDITS: Remove license information, it does not belong there and we don't
    need that any more as debian/copyright file.
  * adt-testreport-*, adt-openbugs-*: Add warning that these scripts are
    unmaintained and deprecated in favour of http://ci.debian.net, debci,
    and/or jenkins. If you still use them, please mail
    autopkgtest-devel@lists.alioth.debian.org!
  * README.package-tests: Document that @builddeps@ also installs make.
    (Closes: #738129)
  * Add Suggests: for schroot and lxc, and explain those in the package
    description.
  * NullRunner.test_timeout_long_test: Increase (unrelated) build timeout from
    3 to 20 s, to cope with the bit of overhead that dpkg-buildpackage
    introduced.

autopkgtest (2.7.1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * VirtSubproc.py, command(): Intercept/retry on EAGAIN.
  * runner/adt-run: Robustify cleanup of empty "binaries" output directory, it
    does not always work in __del__().
  * adt-run: Replace direct invocation of "debian/rules build" with
    "dpkg-buildpackage -us -uc -b". dpkg-buildpackage is the de-facto
    interface these days (also on the buildds), and does additional things now
    such as passing build flags or cleaning the package. This also implies
    dpkg-source --before build to apply patches, so remove the explicit call
    to that again. (Closes: #737632)
  * adt-run: If all tests get skipped, but there are some tests, don't claim
    that there are none. (Closes: #737242)
  * adt-run: When expanding @builddeps@, add "make" as test almost always need
    it to call "make installcheck" or similar.
  * Print package version as first adt-run message ("@devel@" when running out
    of source tree).
  * Turn VirtSubproc.Timeout into a proper exception class (RuntimeError).
  * Make VirtSubproc.bomb() useful outside the mainloop, so that we can
    use it in utility functions that are used outside of runners.
  * VirtSubproc: Add a "timeout" context manager which plumbs timeout_start(),
    timeout_end() and bomb() (if an exit message is given) or a Timeout
    exception (otherwise) together in the right way, for convenience.

 -- Martin Pitt <mpitt@debian.org>  Fri, 07 Feb 2014 14:52:42 +0100

autopkgtest (2.7) unstable; urgency=medium

  * adt-virt-lxc: Drop all the file-based checks for container bootup, and
    replace with "lxc-attach runlevel" to wait until the container booted to a
    numeric runlevel. This greatly simplifies the logic and drops the
    cloud-init requirement so that this runner is now suitable for Debian or
    debootstrap-based Ubuntu containers. (LP: #1273725)
  * adt-virt-lxc.1: Drop --gain-root in notes/example. It's unnecessary
    (adt-run will install fakeroot if missing) and confusing (as it's not
    related to LXC specifically and otherwise not really used/useful).
  * adt-virt-lxc.1: Add example how to create a Debian container, and some
    cleanup of obsolete commentary.
  * adt-virt-lxc: Add -s/--sudo option to run lxc-* commands through sudo; use
    this option if you run adt-run as normal user, but need to run the
    container itself as root (if you use LXC system-level containers).
    This drops the hardcoded sudo commands and thus the dependency on sudo,
    which is more palatable for Debian. (LP: #1273977)
  * adt-virt-lxc: Add -e shortcut for --ephemeral, as this is an option which
    you pretty much always want.
  * adt-virt-lxc.1: Move more important options to the top.
  * adt-virt-lxc: Stop hardcoding the "ubuntu" suggested normal user; instead,
    call "getent passwd" to detect the first user with uid >= 500. Don't
    advertise suggested-normal-user if none exists.
  * adt-run: Rearrange finalizing options and reading capabilities to happen
    after testbed opening. That allows the testbed to determine its full
    capablities in its open hook.
  * adt-run: Call dpkg-source --before-build for --unbuilt-tree arguments, to
    ensure that patches are applied for "3.0 (quilt)" source trees. This is
    useful to test *-buildpackage source trees where patches don't get
    applied. (LP: #1212208)

autopkgtest (2.6.1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * adt-virt-lxc: Call lxc-config through sudo as well like all the other LXC
    commands. This fixes running adt-run as user with the LXC runner.
  * adt-run: For copydown(), always chown the testbed files to the non-root
    user (if available). This fixes a "Permission denied" error with the
    schroot or LXC runners and --unbuilt-tree if the source tree has tight
    permissions. (LP: #1266811)
  * Adjust LxcRunner.test_tree_built_binaries to also work with current apt
    (similar to commit 5798b7f for the schroot runner).
  * adt-virt-lxc: Call "sudo test" and "sudo readlink" instead of os.lexists()
    and os.readlink() as recent LXC now makes the default container dir
    /var/lib/lxc not readably by non-users. Fixes running adt-virt-lxc/adt-run
    as user. (LP: #1266809)
  * Add test for --binary with --built-tree.
  * adt-run.1: Clarify and fix some wrong and misleading documentation what
    happens with debs produced by source packages and specified with --binary.
    (LP: #1175557)

 -- Martin Pitt <mpitt@debian.org>  Wed, 29 Jan 2014 06:53:16 +0100

autopkgtest (2.6) unstable; urgency=medium

  New features:
  * Add --apt-source option as an alternative for --source, implied if
    argument is a valid package name. It calls "apt-get source" in the testbed
    instead of using a .dsc from the host, which for the common case of
    testing packages in the acual archive avoids having to manually download
    the source and then copying it into the testbed. This simplifies the
    command line for running tests for a package in the archive to
    "adt-run mypkgname --- adt-virt-[...]".
  * Add --setup-commands option to run things like "apt-get update" or adding
    apt sources after opening the testbed.

  Bug fixes:
  * adt-virt-lxc: Stop assuming that containers live in /var/lib/lxc/; ask
    lxc-config about the root path instead.
  * Only reset the test bed after the build stage if builds actually happened.
  * Reset the test bed after running a test group, to avoid an unnecessary
    setup if there is just one test.
  * Don't put an empty "binaries" directory into the output directory.

  New test cases:
  * --timeout handling.

autopkgtest (2.5.5) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Test that the schroot runner installs packages with --user, and that it
    runs the tests as root with --user if the test has a "needs-root"
    restriction. (Related to #728304)
  * adt-virt-schroot: Add suggested-normal-user capability to the calling user
    (unless that's root), so that tests are run as user by default.
    (Closes: #728304)
  * Add support for virtual "@builddeps@" test dependency, which will be
    replaced with the package's B-D and B-D-I. Document in

  * Drop hosts/ and {onepackage,ubuntu}-config example files; these scripts

    and/or Jenkins, not from cron.
  * Move adt-testreport-* scripts and manpages into autopkgtest-xenlvm
    package, as they require the xen runner.
  * tests/run-parallel: Immediately stop on pep8/pyflakes errors.
  * Adjust SchrootRunner.test_tree_built_binaries test to also work with
    current apt.
  * Always write UTF-8 to stdout and summary stream, to avoid
    UnicodeEncodeError crash when running in a C locale. (LP: #1259529)
  * tests/pyflakes: Always use pyflakes, not pyflakes3, as the latter doesn't
    get along with non-ASCII strings when running under a non-UTF-8 locale (as
    in sbuild).

autopkgtest (2.5) unstable; urgency=low

  Behaviour changes:
  * Drop --output-dir option. It has never really been useful as it only works
    for paths in the testbed, has a confusing semantics, is redundant with
    --tmp-dir, and currently even crashes adt-run. (Closes: #729790)
  * Rename --tmp-dir option to --output-dir, as its main purpose is really to
    collect test artifacts. Keep --tmp-dir alias for backwards compatibility.
  * Drop --override-control option. It complicates the code too much for its
    very limited utility, and it was not even documented in the manpage.
  * Drop --paths-testbed (and thus also --paths-host) options. There is no
    use case for them.
  * Add short options for common command line options: -B for
    --no-built-binaries, -o for --output-dir, -l for --log-file,
    -u for --user.
  * Clean up uninteresting files from --output-dir directory.
  * Tests which want to create additional artifacts can now put them into the
    $ADT_ARTIFACTS directory. When using the --output-dir option, they will be
    copied into <outputdir>/artifacts/. Document this new feature in
    README.package-tests. (LP: #1137763)

  Packaging changes:
  * Drop obsolete autodebtest Conflicts/Replaces.
  * Update copyright years.
  * Bump Standards-Version to 3.9.5. No changes necessary.
  * CREDITS: Add myself.
  * Makefile: Support $DESTDIR, like automake.
  * Adjust sharedir* defaults in settings.make to what we actually want, and
    drop their overrides in debian/rules
  * Move debian/rules to using dh.
  * Add ./run-from-checkout script to run adt-run from the git checkout or
    source package. Change tests/adt-run to use it.
  * Add tests/run-parallel to run tests for different runners in parallel.

  Bug fixes:
  * Fix OSError crash if --output-dir/--tmp-dir does not exist.
    (Closes: #729791)
  * Pass line number to Test constructor argument, to be able to report proper
    errors instead of crashing. (side issue in #698551)
  * Fix exit code for "Unsupported" error.
  * When encountering an unsupported test, report only this test as skipped,
    not all the others in the same "Tests:" stanza.
  * README.package-tests: Test names must not contain '/'. (Closes: #698551)
  * Create manpage for adt-virt-schroot. (first half of #695974)
  * Fix "su: must be run from a terminal" failure when running as user and
    testbed doesn't provide root-on-testbed. (Closes: #648148)
  * Add bandaid to avoid mixing order of stdout and stderr in the log file
    when reporting results.

  Code cleanup:
  * Simplify logging by dropping the explicit functions for writing to stderr
    plus log, and instead set up pipes so that the whole stdout/stderr will be
    tee'd into the logfile.
  * Replace the usage of the AutoFile classes (which are underdocumented,
    magic, and hard to understand) with a more explicit and much simpler
    TestbedPath class.
  * Stop installing the redundant /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/90autopkgtest into
    testbeds, and simplify invocation of apt-get.

  New test cases:
  * Access /dev/std{out,err} in a non-root test, like the "mafft" autopkgtest
    does.
  * --log-file test cases for chroot and schroot runners.
  * schroot and LXC runner test cases for installing built binaries.
  * --output-dir in schroot runner with complete package build.
  * Recommends do not get installed by default.
  * Test case with '/' in the name.
  * --user option for schroot and null runners.
  * breaks-testbed restriction for all runners.

autopkgtest (2.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add adt-virt-lxc test runner, many thanks to Robie Basak for this! This
    runner provides "revert" and "revert-full-system" capabilities which is
    useful for packages which have the "breaks-testbed" restriction and
    multiple tests. For the time being this only works with the ubuntu-cloud
    template; support for general debian/ubuntu containers requires an
    lxc-wait mechanism ("did the container finish booting?") and getting along
    with the different user setups (debian using "root",  ubuntu using an
    "ubuntu" user with sudo capabilities).
  * Add tests for adt-virt-lxc.
  * Code cleanup to slightly improve readability:
    - Drop two-letter aliases for methods.
    - Consistent usage of quotes.
    - Drop orphaned/unnecessary globals.
    - Consistent logging methods/object names, add some docstrings.
  * Install fakeroot into testbed for "build-needed". Thanks Jean-Baptiste

  * adt-virt-schroot: Add some debugging output of the schroot config.
  * Fix OSError crash with real-time output when running adt-run as non-root
    on the host, and the runner bind-mounts /tmp (such as -schroot), in which
    case the temporary runner dir isn't accessible to the host. This is a
    quickfix, eventually we should make real-time output work properly in this
    situation.
  * Show stderr also for non-zero exit codes.
  * Restrict live stdout/stderr to the null virt runner for now, as it does
    not work properly with the schroot runner even if /tmp gets bind-mounted.
  * Add tests for the schroot runner. Ad building a schroot would be too
    expensive for a test, use an existing schroot if $ADT_TEST_SCHROOT is set,
    otherwise skip the tests.

  * Don't show source_rules_command() "set -x" trace unless running with -d.
  * Kill the tee child process if the testbed bombs out (e. g. due to a

autopkgtest (2.3.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add tests/testpkg/: Simple source package for testing autopkgtest.
  * Add tests/adt-run: Automatic regression tests for adt-run, covering/using
    the null runner.
  * Add debian/tests: autopkgtest for autopkgtest, using tests/adt-run.
  * Make topmost temporary directory group/world-readable and make $ADTTMP
    have appropriate 1777 permissions so that users other than root can
    actually use it. (Closes: #722458)
  * Don't clip first stderr line to 35 characters in summary. (Side issue in
    #722457)
  * Don't show shell tracing of script that creates the temporary directories.
  * Move unimportant messages to debug level 1, to not clutter up default
    output so much.
  * Drop unnecessary "trace: " from adt-run debug/progress lines.
  * Show stdout/err of the running tests in realtime, which is much nicer for
    watching. Don't split that realtime output, so that stderr messages appear
    in the right context. Show separate stderr if and only if the allow-stderr
    restriction is not set and there is stderr output. (Closes: #722457)
  * For tests with "build-needed", actually run the tests in the built
    directory, not in the original unbuilt tree. (Closes: #711209)
  * Fix various unknown and unused symbols throughout the source, spotted by
    pyflakes.
  * Add tests/pyflakes: Run pyflakes over source and test code.
  * Add tests/pep8: Run pep8 over source and test code.
  * Support empty "Depends:" test control field, installing no dependencies in
    that case.
  * README.package-tests: Point out that you can use upper-case test names as
    well. Update test_tree_tmp_dir() test to use these, to ensure it stays
    working. (Closes: #711844)
  * Some code cleanups:
    - Don't rename modules on import.
    - Format to be PEP-8 compliant.
    - Rename first argument of methods to "self", as that's the wide
      convention, gets rid of some single-letter variable names, and makes it
      a bit easier to see which variables refer to foreign objects.
  * Run tests/pep8 and tests/pyflakes during package build.

    errors. Thanks Robie Basak!
  * runner/adt-run: Short-circuit publishing if there are no registered built
    binaries. This is the step that takes by far the longest time for short
    tests, and thus speeds up test running significantly.

    Well, actually, that's just according to the spec.  In reality, for

  * pass count= to dd for erasure when lvm_erasebase=true.

  Bugfixes:
  * Fix filename pattern bug which can prevent automatic keypair
    generation (false claim that privkey and pubkey do not match).
  * Do not demand vg or distro information for initscript to work.
  * export adt_* variable settings resulting from command-line
    arguments so that subprocesses get them properly, and arrange
    for the `defaults for simple settings' not to override environment
    variables.
  * suppress various variable settings' default computations (and
    consequent failure if the default can't be established) when
    processing config for the initscript.  The initscript does not
    need per-testbed configuration options.
  * close fd 8 when running vgdisplay (which avoids an annoying and
    spurious warning from the lvm tools).

  Packaging:
  * autopkgtest-xenlvm now Recommends: lvm2 and debootstrap.
  * autopkgtest Suggests curl (adt-testreport-onepackage needs it).

  Portability:
  * Check for udev persistent-net-generator and if enabled we
    write a rune for eth0 for guest_macaddr into the RULES_FILE
    specified in /lib/udev/write_net_rules.  (Needed for gutsy.)
  * Remove iwj-specific stuff from adt-testreport-onepackage and put
    it into onepackage-config with scary warnings to tell people to

  * adt-testreport-onepackage: new ability to test binary as well as
    source packages, using new --instantiate option.
  * new `timeout=' option on `execute' virt server command.
  * set some default timeouts (these should be settable with options,
    really).
  * Default kernel image guesser is more sophisticated - now we look
    for something that looks like a Xen kernel rather than guessing
    from the filename since the filenames seem unstable.
  * Default setting for adt_fw_allowglobalports is none.
  * Set DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive.
  * Run udevsettle after xm destroy but before dmsetup remove.
  * Run sendmail -odi not -odq in adt-testreport-onepackage.
  * Longer timeouts by default.
  * Print `adt-run: trace' for trace output.
  * Show all apt stdout (including dpkg stdout) in contemporaneous trace.
