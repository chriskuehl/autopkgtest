not needed for demo:

- check how to run test against existing binaries from archive
  tried 
    ./adt-run --tmp-dir=`pwd`/d -d --no-built-binaries --binaries=auto --binary ../../Mawk/mawk_1.3.3-11ubuntu2_i386.deb ../../Mawk/ancient/mawk_1.3.3-11ubuntu2.dsc --- ../virt-subproc/adt-virt-schroot wheezy-snap
  but it seemed to do install of old mawk before build

- remove dependency on python in testbed

- schroot's snapshots should use dmsetup directly, not lvm ?
    at least there should be non-persistent snapshots

- schroot snapshots share /tmp and /home which is a bit strange
  need to make 'revert' property more granular
