not needed for demo:

- file bugs against pbuilder-satisfydepends
    * uses "/usr/bin/apt-get"
    * --internal-chrootexec should be exposed
    * .dsc parsing bug (last line ignored)

- remove dependency on python in testbed

- Nightmare shell quoting situation:
    * satdep-auxverb and the sh -c hack
    * testbeds should provide /only/ print-execute-command auxverb

- schroot's snapshots should use dmsetup directly, not lvm ?
    at least there should be non-persistent snapshots
