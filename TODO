not needed for demo:

- check how to run test against existing binaries from archive
  tried 
    ./adt-run --tmp-dir=`pwd`/d -d --no-built-binaries --binaries=auto --binary ../../Mawk/mawk_1.3.3-11ubuntu2_i386.deb ../../Mawk/ancient/mawk_1.3.3-11ubuntu2.dsc --- ../virt-subproc/adt-virt-schroot wheezy-snap
  but it seemed to do install of old mawk before build

- file bugs against pbuilder-satisfydepends
    * uses "/usr/bin/apt-get"
    * --internal-chrootexec should be exposed
    * .dsc parsing bug (last line ignored)

- remove dependency on python in testbed

- Nightmare shell quoting situation:
    * satdep-auxverb and the sh -c hack
    * testbeds should provide /only/ print-execute-command auxverb

- schroot's snapshots should use dmsetup directly, not lvm ?
    at least there should be non-persistent snapshots
