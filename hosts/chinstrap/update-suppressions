# This is an absolutely hideous hack.
#
# We scrape a suitable launchpad advanced search to find bugs we've
# previously submitted.
#
# We have to run this on chinstrap instead of
# cadmium because cadmium (being treated as a buildd from a security
# point of view) is not permitted to make external requests other than
# to the archive.
#
#
# For the reasons described below this should be replaced ASAP!
#
# BUGS
# 
# This will break if the list gets too long for LP to display.
#
# Also, there is a problem with Duplicate bugs.  See LP #147754.  A
# tedious workaround is needed for this case.  When an autopkgtest
# bug, which was marked a duplicate and not the master, is fixed, the
# duplicate target will be marked fixed.  To work around the LP bug,
# it is necessary to adjust the status of the autopkgtest-filed bug:
#  1. unduplicate the bug; 2. set it to Fix Released;
#  3. duplicate it again.
#
# Occasionally LP seems to burp and give us an empty page.
# This means that a cronmail is generated which reports
#   NO SUPPRESSIONS - PROBABLY WENT WRONG
# It is not clear whether the lack of any error message or nonzero
# exit status from curl is a bug in curl or LP.

# Furthermore, much of this functionality is now in
# adt-suppressions-update and the LP part should be in a script called
# adt-suppressions-fetch-launchpad.
