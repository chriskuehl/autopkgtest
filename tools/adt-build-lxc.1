.SH NAME
adt-build-lxc \- Create or update autopkgtest container for adt\-virt-lxc

.SH SYNOPSYS
.B adt-build-lxc
.I distribution release

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B adt-build-lxc
creates or updates an LXC container \fBadt-\fIrelease\fR which is suitable for
autopkgtest's LXC runner \fBadt-virt-lxc\fR(1).

It calls
.B lxc-create
with the
.I distribution
template (which can currently be
.B debian
or
.B ubuntu) and
.BI -r release
to build a debootstrap-like container, then enables
.B deb-src
apt sources, and runs
.B apt-get update\fR.

If the container already exists, it updates it as unintrusively as possible by
first creating a new temporary container \fBadt-\fIrelease\fB.new\fR, and then
rsyncing its root file system back to the existing \fBadt-\fIrelease\fR. Note
that this could cause some side-effects and breakage if you have running
containers with ephemeral overlays (i. e. using the
.B --ephemeral
option), but it does work in general. This update process does not interfere at
all if you use
.B adt-virt-lxc
with cloning.

Note that you need to call this as root, unless you set up LXC to allow
per-user containers. But user containers will not work with many or even most
autopkgtests.
